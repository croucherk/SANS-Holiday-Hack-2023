# The 2023 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge

## Description

The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge is an annual online cyber security *capture the flag*[^1]  during the holiday season. It features a series of fun, practical, and informative technical challenges suited to participants of all skill levels. The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge also includes KringleCon[^2], a completely virtual and free hacker conference featuring a handful of interesting talks by reputable voices in the cyber security industry. The SANS Holiday Hack is produced by the SANS Institute[^3], an organization offering some of the highest quality cyber security training, certifications, courses, and cyber range[^4] programs in the industry.

This year, the theme of the challenge was *artificial intelligence* (AI)[^5], and this theme was reflected in both the challenge's game design and the structure of some of the technical challenges. It is recommended by the producers of the challenge that participants register free account(s) on OpenAI's ChatGPT[^6], Google's Bard[^7], Microsoft's Bing AI-powered copilot utility[^8], or similar free AI tools to complete the challenges.

## Contest Instructions

Participants in the challenge may also choose to participate in the contest to win a prize. To compete in the contest, participants must submit their write-up by the end of day on **January 5, 2024**, and use some form of AI in solving at least some of the challenges. The AI prompts as well as responses must be included to qualify in the contest. Completion of the entire challenge is not mandatory for eligibility in the contest.

As part of my efforts in competing in the contest, I chose to use OpenAI's ChatGPT to assist me in answering some questions that came up during the challenge. To add a small twist, I asked ChatGPT to answer the questions in various dictions (e.g. pirate, lawyerese, Vulcan, etc.) with a "Plain English" translation for each answer.
